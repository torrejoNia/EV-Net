**EV-Net: Extracellular vesicles-mediated intercellular communication networks.** EV-Net enables the exploration of how extracellular vesicles (EVs) cargo influences receiving tissues of interest.

## Installation

Installation typically takes a few minutes, depending on how many dependencies are already installed on your system. You can install EV-Net (and its required dependencies) directly from GitHub:


``` r
if(!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools") 
}

devtools::install_github("torrejoNia/EV-Net")
```

EV-Net has been tested on both Windows and Linux.
Most recently tested with R version 4.5.1.
